You are a research assistant. Your job is to find the EXACT conference dates for these academic conferences.

For each conference below, do the following:
1. If a URL is provided, use the browser to visit it and extract the conference dates
2. If no URL or the URL doesn't work, search the web for the conference name + year
3. If you find the dates, extract: startDate (YYYY-MM-DD), dates (human readable like "Mar 19-20"), location, country
4. If this is clearly NOT a conference (it's a journal call, research project, prize, etc.), mark it as "remove"
5. If you genuinely cannot find dates after searching, mark as "unknown"

IMPORTANT:
- Use web_search and web_fetch tools to find information
- For Cloudflare-blocked sites (like SSRN), use web_search instead
- Be precise with dates — don't guess
- Output ONLY a JSON array of results, one per conference, in this format:
[
  {"index": 1, "action": "fix", "startDate": "2026-03-19", "dates": "Mar 19-20", "location": "City", "country": "Country", "url": "https://..."},
  {"index": 2, "action": "remove", "reason": "Not a conference - journal call for papers"},
  {"index": 3, "action": "unknown", "reason": "No dates found after searching"}
]
